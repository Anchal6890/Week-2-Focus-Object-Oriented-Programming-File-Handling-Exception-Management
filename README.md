## ✅ Task Details

### 🔹 Task 1: Create Custom Classes
- Created a `Student` class using `__init__()` constructor.
- Displayed student details using a method.
- Demonstrated creation and use of class objects.

### 🔹 Task 2: Inheritance & Access Modifiers
- Implemented a `Vehicle` base class and a `Car` child class.
- Demonstrated public, protected (`_`), and private (`__`) access modifiers.
- Used `super()` to initialize inherited attributes.

### 🔹 Task 3: File-Based Data Storage
- Collected user input (name and feedback).
- Stored feedback in a text file using `with open()`.
- Ensured proper file handling with append mode.

### 🔹 Task 4: Exception-Safe Code
- Handled `ZeroDivisionError` and `ValueError` using `try-except-finally`.
- Performed basic arithmetic operation safely.
- Ensured user-friendly error messages.
